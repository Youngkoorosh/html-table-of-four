## 🌸 Purpose

To honor the invited.  
To render presence in rows and columns.  
To let HTML speak softly.

---

## 🧭 Structure

- `thead` — the beginning, the naming of space  
- `tbody` — the unfolding of identity  
- `tfoot` — the count, the echo, the closure

---

## 📜 Details

- Three columns: index, name, surname  
- Footer spans two columns to whisper the total  
- HTML only. No scripts. No embellishments.

## 🕊️ License

Unlicensed.  
Use it gently.  
Let it be a vessel.

A soul who sees markup as memory.
